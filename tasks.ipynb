    "Numeric values in python usually are defined as type ```int``` or ```float``` (can also be complex). ```int``` variable types are whole numbers with no decimal places. They are ideal for performing addition or subtraction but if we are to perform any arithmetic involving division such as calculating means or average values, then our calculated value would turn into a ```float``` by default python logic. ```float``` or floating-point variables are used to store values with decimal points. Arithmetic on float values will always result in another float value and will display a value after the decimal point even if the value is $.0$.   \n",
